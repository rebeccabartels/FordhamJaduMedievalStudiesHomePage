<p>The Medieval Studies program was founded in 1971 to promote the interdisciplinary study of the Middle Ages. By the late 1970s, the program had grown to include an undergraduate element and was housed in the Center for Medieval Studies, which has become one of Fordham&#39;s most active and well-known centers of advanced study.</p>

<p>Located at the Rose Hill campus, the Center for Medieval Studies houses three offices, a small library, and a seminar room. The Center administers the Medieval Studies Program, which offers an <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/23059/undergraduate_studies">interdisciplinary undergraduate BA in Medieval Studies</a> and <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/23058/graduate_studies">graduate MA in Medieval Studies</a>, as well as an<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/23058/graduate_studies/4552/doctoral_certificate"> Advanced Doctoral Certificate in Medieval Studies</a> for PhD students enrolled in one of the participating departments. Special facilities for medievalists, including a Paleography Room, Archives Room, and the O&#39;Hare Special Collections, are offered at <a href="http://www.library.fordham.edu/">Walsh Library</a>, which is especially strong in its medieval holdings. Fordham&#39;s location in <a href="http://www.web.fordham.edu/info/23064/medieval_new_york">New York City</a> also affords easy access to major libraries, museums, and other institutions of higher learning. The Center for Medieval Studies participates in the New York Metropolitan Area <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/homepage/2592/medieval_doctoral_consortium">Medieval Doctoral Consortium</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The integrated interdisciplinary approach to the Middle Ages is a natural extension of Fordham&#39;s long-standing commitment to the study of this crucial historical period, which has attracted some of the University&#39;s most distinguished faculty and students. The emphases on intellectual diversity, depth of study, and rigorous scholarship that underlie the degree and outreach programs of the Center resonate strongly with Fordham&#39;s Jesuit tradition and institutional goals, particularly with its dedication to teaching and to close student-faculty interaction, with its devotion to scholarship and ethical values, and with its stress on critical thinking and communication. The Center supports the exchange of views and information through its <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/23072/conferences">annual conferences</a>, <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/23061/events/4558/lectures">lecture series</a>, and ongoing <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/23073/symposia_and_workshops">professional workshops</a>, providing a community of scholarship for all those interested in the middle ages.</p>
